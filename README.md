<img src="assets\waypoint_wizard.webp" width="500" height="500">

Waypoint Wizard is a Discord bot currently under development, designed to enhance the Minecraft experience by integrating waypoint management and visualization from the Xaero's Minimap mod. The bot monitors in-game chat for waypoints shared by players, compiles a searchable database, and provides various features to improve gameplay.

**Note:** This bot is currently not in a functioning state as it is still under development.

## Features

- **Waypoint Database:** Automatically detects and stores waypoints shared in in-game chat.
- **Waypoint Retrieval:** Provides users with their stored waypoints on demand.
- **Map Generation:** Generates maps displaying waypoint locations based on the server's map seed.
- **Seed Integration:** Seamlessly integrates with the Minecraft world seed to ensure accurate map visuals.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- A Discord bot token ([Get one here](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
- Xaero's Minimap installed on the Minecraft server
